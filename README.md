# 🌍 Waytrek — Travel Experience Platform  

---

## 🚀 What is Waytrek?
Waytrek is a next-generation **travel experience platform** designed to help people explore the world based on personal preferences, local culture and meaningful journeys — not ads, crowds or generic travel packages.

We shift travel from:
> “Where should I go?”  
to  
> “What kind of journey fits who I am?”

---

## 🧠 Why now?
Current travel platforms are overcrowded, commercialized and biased.
Travelers no longer discover — they replicate.

Waytrek enables:
- Authentic exploration
- Local knowledge & storytelling
- Personalized recommendations
- Community-powered content

Starting from Vietnam → scaling globally.
